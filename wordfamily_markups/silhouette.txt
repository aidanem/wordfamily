Étienne de Silhouette, a French politician of Basque ancestry, was the Controller-General of Finances under Louis XV in 1759. His measures to curb the national debt, notably by imposing new taxes on the rich and the nobility prompted a backlash and ultimately his dismissal after less than a year leaving the work unfinished. This lead to the derogatory phrase `(faire quelque chose) à la Silhouette`=fra-Latn to mean "(to do something) in a cheap, miserly, or unfinished way".

Around the same time, black paper silhouette portraits became popular in France, and were derided as a cheap option for portraits—`portrait à la Silhouette`=fra-Latn.

The name `Silhouette`=fra-Latn is from Basque `Zulueta`=eus-Latn (archaic variant `Zilhoeta`=eus-Latn), from Basque `zulo`=eus-Latn: "hole, pit, hiding place, cave". Spanish `silo`=spa-Latn is of unclear origin, it may be from `zulo`=eus-Latn. Or `silo`=spa-Latn could be from Greek σιρός <siros>: "pit, pitfall, pit for storing grain", but that is again of unclear and probably non-Greek origin—maybe the same European neolithic substrate as underlies the Basque?

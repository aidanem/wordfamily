The Celtic word <*d≈´nom>: "hill fort" was borrowed into Germanic twice, once as "hill" and once as "fort".

The first time was borrowed before the completion of Grimm's Law, so Grimm's Law changed the <*d> to <*t> for Germanic <*t≈´nƒÖ>: "enclosure", which eventually gave English "town"

The second time appears to have been a borrowing specifically from Gaulish into West Germanic, after each family had split into subfamilies and Grimm's law was no longer active, so we get West Germanic <*d≈´n«≠>: "hill". This gives English "down", meaning a hill; and eventually "down" the direction, which comes from the compound `ad≈´ne`/`ofd≈´ne` meaning "off the hill, downhill".

While some sources list the PIE root <*d ∞ewH-> as an origin, I don't know of any good evidence for this as a root and not just a Proto-Celtic word <*d≈´nom>, except for a possible connection to Latin `funus`, which would still not be enough to push it all the way back to PIE.

# Old English `Briudun`=ang-Latn is a compound of Old English `dun`=ang-Latn: "hill" (borrowed from Celtic <*dunum>: "hillfort") plus a form of Celtic <*brix>: "hill". In later English, as `dun`/`down` became less common, it was elaborated again as `Breedon on the Hill`=eng-Latn ("Hill-hill on the hill").

My son suggests: "Downtown Breedon on the Hill" üòÜ

## The Old Welsh `Myrddin`=owl-Latn, which underlies the place name `Caerfyrddin`=cym-Latn/`Carmarthen`=eng-Latn, is probably unrelated to Old Welsh `Myrddin`=owl-Latn which is the source of the mythical name `Merlin`=eng-Latn.

#### `Lugdunum`=xtg-Latn is sometimes also given as origin of `London`=eng-Latn, but that doesn't stand up to reconstruction. Comparison of the Latin, Old English, and Welsh names of `London`=eng-Latn point towards a Celtic reconstruction looking more like <*Londonjon>, possibly meaning "sunken (or flooded) place".

Turtledoves are not named after turtles, in fact "turtle" has meant the bird for longer than it meant the reptile.

In Middle English `tortu` meant "turtle" (from Latin `tortuca`) and `turtel` mean "turtledove" (from Latin `turtur`), then they collapsed into "turtle". The modern meaning of "turtle" won out, and made the meaning of the bird obsolete, leaving the elaborated form `turteldoufe` -> `turtledove`. (Compare the parallel German words `Turtel` and `Turteltaube`, which both still mean "turtle dove", but there also, the elaborated `Turteltaube` has mostly replaced the simple `Turtel`.)

The Old English word for "turtle" is `byrdling`, which has nothing to do with birds; it is in fact "board-ling" (that is, "shieldling").

##### Verb forms of the root <*teter-> probably don't exist. The two possibilities are Greek τετράζω (tetrázō) ‘cackle’ and Latin tetrinniō ‘quack’. Greek <-azō> verbs are usually later formations (not inherited from PIE) and Latin <-inniō> verbs are, as far as I know, all onomatopoeias: `(ad)hinniō`: "whinny", `tinniō`: "jingle, clink" (whence `tinnitus`), and `tertinniō`: quack" are basically the whole set. There is no particular evidence that any of the Latin <inniō> verbs are inherited from PIE, and no decent path derive `tertinniō` from <*teter->. A -ne- infix verb form would be the closest thing, and there's a whole bunch of things wrong with that idea.


#### Classical Greek `Τάρτᾰρος` <Tártaros>: "Tartarus, Hades, Hell" was thought by Strabo to be a fanciful modification of `Ταρτησσός` <Tartēssós>, a semi-mythical port beyond the Pillars of Herakles (in southwest Iberia). I am unaware of any better ideas since then.

`Ταρτησσός` <Tartēssós> may in turn represent a Phoenician colony, possibly cognate with Phoenician `𐤕𐤓𐤔𐤔‎` <tršš> and Hebrew `תַּרְשִׁישׁ` <Taršīš>. In Ezekiel 27, Tarshish is said to have "exchanged silver, iron, tin and lead" for the merchandise of Tyre—which is pretty much what the Phoenicians were doing in southwest Iberia.

The ethnonym `Tartar` is a modification of Old Turkic `𐱃𐱃𐰺` <Tatar> by association with `Tartarus`, so the form `Tatar` is preferable, being more accurate and less judgmental. The naming of "steak tartare" is likewise based on Medieval European derogatory ideas of Tatars and other steppe cultures.



# The Greek `ταρταροῦχος` <tartaroûkhos>: "keepers of Tartarus" is used in the apocrypha Apocalypse of Paul to refer to a class of demons who torture damned souls in hell, and one or two other early gnostic/hermetic sources.

Medieval Latin `tortuca`: "turtle, tortoise" is of unknown origin, but one possibility is that turtles got associated with these demons and it comes from <tartaroûkhos>, or a related form like <(thērion) tartaroûkhon> -> `(bēstia) tartaruca` -> `tortuca`. This could have been influenced by sound similarity to `testūdō`: "turtle, tortoise" (from `testa`: "pot, pottery, tile, shell", itself of disputed origin). The other likely possibility is that it could be from `tortus`: "twisted" due the shape of turtle's legs and feet.

I have seen several sources say that turtles were associated with the underworld in Late Hellenic/Early Christian symbolism but not any source that seems particularly definitive. While there definitely were some negative associations (turtles representing the burden of sin, etc.), I'm not yet sure someone didn't made up the association with the underworld at some point to justify connecting `tortuca` with <tartaroûkhos>.

### Latin `turtur` could be related to all the <*tetr-> bird words; but it is the only one with an <r> in the first syllable, and one of the few that does not refer to a bird from the order Galliformes (landfowl).

It could also be an independent onomatopoeia, or it could be related to the Northwest Semitic words: Hebrew `​​תּוֹר` <tōr> and Ugaritic `𐎚𐎗` <tr>: "turtle dove".

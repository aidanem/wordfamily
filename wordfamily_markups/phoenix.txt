# Egypt got much of its lumber in trade from Canaan/Lebanon


## There are many theories about what <po-ni-ki-jo> might refer to. In context, all that can be deduced for certain is that it is a trade commodity. But it is formally equivalent to later Classical Greek `φοῖνῐξ` <phoînix>.

Classical Greek `φοῖνῐξ` <phoînix> means a number of things, but probably at heart means "Phoenician" and from there is used to refer to a number of things associated with the Phoenicians: Tyrean purple (the famous dye of the Pheonicians), date palm trees, dates, a Phoenician musical instrument, and the phoenix.

It is probably a conflation of two or more etymologies, including Egyptian <fnḫw>: "Canaanites", Greek `φοινός` <phoinós>: "bloody, blood-red", Egyptian <bnw>: "a divine bird associated with rebirth", and/or a Semitic root which also gave Arabic `فُوَّه` <fuwwah>: "madder, reddish-purple". One or more of these sources might come from one of the others.



### Tifinagh is a Tamazight writing system descendant of the Phoenician alphabet. The name is likely a feminine plural cognate of "Punic", (ti- is a feminine nominalization prefix in Tamazight languages); thus `tifinagh` reasonably means "the Phoenician (letters)".


#### This is a very abbreviated treatment of PIE <*gʷʰen->, which is a large and important family itself, and probably not the most important of the sources conflated into `φοῖνῐξ` <phoînix>.

start notes


# The first consonant of the Semitic root is ambiguous. The Arabic form points to <*ġ> (/ɣ/), but Akkadian should have <ḫ> (/χ/) in that case; instead the Akkadian has e-coloring and no consonant, which should come from Semitic <*ʕ>. Aramaic, Hebrew, and Phoenician forms can't help answer the question, because <*ġ> and <*ʕ> merged in Northwest Semitic.

If the Proto-Indo-European <*h₁régʷos> is related, IE <*h₁> usually corresponds to Semitic <*ʔ>, <h₂> is the usual correspondence to Semitic <*ʕ>.


## Εὐρώπη` <Eurṓpē> is traditionally derived in Greek as "broad-face", the name of a mythological Phoenician princess abducted by Zeus and brought to Crete. This is almost certainly a folk-etymology of a non-Greek borrowing.

Given that (1) the mythological Europa is described as a Phoenician princess, (2) the Phoenician word for "west" is <*'irōb>, which is phoentically similar to `Εὐρώπη` <Eurṓpē>, and (3) Greece is to the west of Phoenicia; Phoenician <*'irōb> is a very likely candidate for what the Greeks folk-etymologized as `Εὐρώπη` <Eurṓpē>.


### Modern Mandarian `歐洲` <Ōuzhōu> is formed by abbreviation of `歐羅巴` <Ōuluóbā> to <歐> and then suffixing `洲` <zhōu>: "continent". The same process is used to create the modern forms of the other continent names, such as <Yàzhōu>: "Asia" from <Yàxìyà>; or <Fēizhōu>: "Africa" from <Āfēilìjiā>




#### English <earnest> as in "down payment, surety", of uncertain etymology, but probably a mixture of French <arrhes>: "down payment, surety" and Old English <eornost>: "sincerity, earnestness"



##### Arabian self-designation is of uncertain origin. It is the same triconsonantal root in some but not all Semitic languages, but does not follow the normal rules for which languages merge [ɣ] and [ʕ]. The most likely explanation is that it is a doublet borrowing of the root for "west" from Eastern Semitic.

Note that Akkadian (Eastern Semitic) is the politically dominant language of Mesopotamia approximately 2300 BCE - 800 BCE.

"Where does the term ‘Arab come from? It is impossible to know for sure, but there are many theories. A popular one relates it to the root ‘-b-r, which gives the name of the Hebrew language. The best explanation IMO is a derivation from the root ġ-r-b ‘west’ > ‘westerners’.
This makes sense geographically. The name wouldn’t have originated in Arabic; it was a term used by outsiders to refer to the land/people/language, comparable to the term Amorite < Mar.tu ‘westerner’. But it must have been adopted by the people it referred to early on."




#### We know there are borrowings from Semitic into Indo-European, so this similarity bears a second look. And there are no attested words coming from any morphological form other than <*h₁régʷos> (and secondary derivations from there), which could also point to a borrowed word that was fit to an adjective morphology, but that never had a root form.

On the other hand, the forms don't match up quite well enough to prove a connection. PIE <*h₁> usually corresponds to Semitic <*ʔ> (see note 1), and similarly Semitic <*b> and PIE <*gʷ> are close neighbors, but not identical. <*gʷ> to <*b> would be a normal and expected distortion in borrowing, but <*b> to <*gʷ> is much less expected.


####### Replaced Old Armenian `տիւ` <tiw>: "day" from Proto-Indo-European <*diwoh₁>: "bright", which was from the same root as many other IE words for "day" Latin `dies`, Welsh `dydd`, Sanskrit `दिन` <diná>

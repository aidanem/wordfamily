## Three variations on the Germanic stem <*wrōt->: <*wrōt->, <*wurt->, and <*urt->. These are not unusual variations: the second is the oblique stem expected in genitive/dative/instrumental cases, and the third is  form of the second where the very similar sounds <w> and <u> in sequence have collapsed into a single <u>. But unusual things seem to have happened to them. While these would almost certainly have been clearly one word to speakers of Pre-Germanic and Early Common Germanic, by the time of Late Common Germanic, it is not clear if these are understood as one, two, or three different words!

The basic stem <*wrōt-> is attested only in (or through) North Germanic, but is absent in East and West Germanic.

In East and West Germanic <*wrōt-> is replaced with a backformation of the oblique stem <*wurt>, giving Gothic <waurts> and English `wort`. East and West Germanic also seem to have a separate <*urt-> stem, but it is only attested in derived forms: <*urtōną> and <*urtgardaz>, so maybe it is not a separate stem, just compounds failing to preserve the stem perfectly.

But then things are complicated by the Old Norse `urt` as separate from Old Norse `rót`. Old Norse has a compulsory collapse of Germanic <*wu> into Old Norse `u`, so this form could come from either Germanic <*wurt-> or <*urt->.

The lexicalization of the split could have been in Late Common Germanic, with the <*wrōt-> later lost in East and West Germanic. Or re-analysis of a phonologically difficult direct form could have ocurred repeaatedly in different ways in the different branches. Or there could be some cross-dialect borrowings as these three branches (plus whatever other branches there once were, now extinct and unattested) diverged into distinct but mutually intelligible dialects of Late Common Germanic.

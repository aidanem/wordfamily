In which "olive oil" is redundant.

The Greek and Armenian words are often interpreted as being from a Mediterranean substrate word. But then there's the Slavic <*lȏjь>: "tallow, suet" and Old Chinese <lɯw>: "oil, grease", which is plausibly from the Tocharian equivalent of Slavic <*lȏjь>, and all three could plausibly derive from a PIE form along the lines of <*h₁loiwom?>, or some other shared source.

startnotes

## `gas`—short for `gasoline`—is unrelated to the word `gas` meaning a vapor, except that it probably influenced the distortion and clipping of `Cazeline`. `Cazeline` is a brand name of lamp oil; presumably a portmanteau of `(John) Cassell` (who invented and sold it) and `linoleum` (literally "flax seed oil").

When John Cassell asked Samuel Boyd to stop selling counterfeit Cazeline Oil, Boyd changed the name to `gazeline`, and so `gazeline`, later `gasoline` became the generic brand of `Cazeline`.

### A mineral oil distillate was sold under the name `petrol`, short for `petroleum` (lit. "rock oil"). It was originally sold as a solvent by a company called "Carless", founded by Eugene Carless.

This name became rather funny in retrospect after petrol was found a suitable fuel in internal combustion engines. But the surname is probably derived from an Old English nickname `Carlēas`, which is really related to "careless" not to "cars".
